# Velda Methodology

### Policy Description:

The Velda methodology is designed to measure the emissions reductions from reducing carbon intensity of water Consumption in emerging markets which comprises of developing contries where fuel generators are predominately used to power borehole pumps. Velda can be used to monitor the emissions reductions that result from the sustainable use of simple, cheaper concentrated solar power systems. This methodology can be used in sunbelt regions, and it only applies in situations where the soil organic carbon levels would stay the same or decrease without the project. The workflow is designed to reflect the general roles and processes of the VCS program. The schema was designed to capture the monitoring parameters required for using concentrated solar power systems. By following the workflow and adhering to program standards, projects can be verified and issued VCUs that represent the emissions reductions achieved, contributing to the global effort to address climate change.

### Workflow Description

- The Velda workflow begins with the Project Proponent submitting a project description (PD) to a standard issuer (example verra). The project description will include ex-ante estimates of the monitoring parameters, as well as other project details to demonstrate alignment with the VCS program requirements. Verra then adds the PD and project docs to the Project Pipeline and Project Registry.

- Next, the Validation and Verification Body (VVB) will assess and validate the PD and provide a Validation Report. The Project Proponent will then conduct monitoring and develop a Monitoring Report, replacing the ex-ante estimates with ex-post MRV data and submit it to the VVB. The VVB then verifies the Monitoring Report and delivers a Verification Report, Verification Representation, and Verification Statement.

- Finally, Issuer reviews the issuance request, and verified carbon units (VCUs) are issued to the Project Proponent. These VCUs represent the emissions reductions achieved through the project.

### Roles

In the Velda workflow, the roles would be represented as follows:

- Project Proponent: The entity or organization that proposes the project and takes responsibility for its implementation and monitoring.

- Issuer: The organization that manages the VCS program and provides oversight and guidance to ensure projects adhere to program standards.

- Validation and Verification Body (VVB): An independent third-party organization responsible for validating the project design and verifying the emissions reductions achieved through the project.
