# Velda Methodology

### Policy Description:

The Velda methodology aims to measure the emissions reductions resulting from the use of simple, cheaper concentrated solar power systems for pumping water in emerging markets. The methodology is designed for developing countries where fuel generators are predominantly used to power borehole pumps. The Velda methodology is a modification of the existing methodology, `Verra VM0038`, and can be used in sunbelt regions. It applies only in situations where the soil organic carbon levels would stay the same or decrease without the project. This repository contains our policy for VM0038 that we have developed with Velda methodology. By following similar workflow in VM0038 and adhering to program standards, projects can be verified and issued VCUs that represent the emissions reductions achieved, contributing to the global effort to address climate change.

Our policy for VM0038 has been uploaded to the Guardian platform:

### Workflow Description

- The Velda workflow begins with the Project Proponent submitting a project description (PD) to a standard issuer (example verra). The project description will include ex-ante estimates of the monitoring parameters, as well as other project details to demonstrate alignment with the VCS program requirements. Verra then adds the PD and project docs to the Project Pipeline and Project Registry.

- Next, the Validation and Verification Body (VVB) will assess and validate the PD and provide a Validation Report. The Project Proponent will then conduct monitoring and develop a Monitoring Report, replacing the ex-ante estimates with ex-post MRV data and submit it to the VVB. The VVB then verifies the Monitoring Report and delivers a Verification Report, Verification Representation, and Verification Statement.

- Finally, Issuer reviews the issuance request, and verified carbon units (VCUs) are issued to the Project Proponent. These VCUs represent the emissions reductions achieved through the project.

### Roles

In the Velda workflow, the roles would be represented as follows:

- Project Proponent: The entity or organization that proposes the project and takes responsibility for its implementation and monitoring.

- Issuer: The organization that manages the VCS program and provides oversight and guidance to ensure projects adhere to program standards.

- Validation and Verification Body (VVB): An independent third-party organization responsible for validating the project design and verifying the emissions reductions achieved through the project.

### VM0038 vs Velda

While VM0038 measures reductions from using electric vehicles instead of fossil fuel-powered vehicles, Velda methodology measures the use of modular concentrated solar power systems instead of fossil fuel-powered generators for pumping water in homes. The baseline emissions in VM0038 are measured in terms of miles per hour that vehicles drive each day in a year, while in Velda methodology, the baseline emissions are measured in terms of how many hours the generators are powered each day to pump water.
